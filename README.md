# Make Money Broker


## Objective

This site was created with the intention of remembering initial concepts that I learned in my studies on the web. It simulates a stockbroker, only in a very simplified way and with few functions.

## Development

 * This site has a main page, where it presents a carousel with some curiosities, just below you will find 3 links that will take you to the B3 website, the product page of the website and a video that discusses the day trade

 * We have a product page where we can find cards with various world currencies and their values in the "Coins" section.

 * On the last page you will find a form that will ask for some of your information, even if you fill in the form and submit it, it will show an alert informing you that your data has not been sent. This is because there is no backend involved for submitting forms. Beside you will also find contact information, this information is all fake.

 * The site consists of the following technologies: it was written in HTML, styled with CSS and I also used a library called Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) which helped me style the site and make it responsive. I used JavaScript and Jquery to dynamically create HTML elements using data pulled from the free currencyAPI (https://freecurrencyapi.net/) and Postman (https://www.postman.com/) APIs. Both are public, you can find the endpoints in the script.js file, I used Jquery to make requests and select HTML elements through selectors.

## Concluding
  The purpose of this project is to work with early technologies for web development and show that it is possible to build something elegant, modern, responsive and functional with an initial/intermediate knowledge.
